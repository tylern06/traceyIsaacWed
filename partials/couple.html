          On a warm autumn afternoon, a young man sat alone at a small coffee shop. He was anxious. Anxious about this girl he was meeting and whether they'd have anything in common. As he sat there waiting, a young woman walked in and hesitatingly searched the faces in the coffee shop for the guy she was supposed to meet. As the young woman made her way through the shop, she saw him, smiling from a table across the room. "That has to be him,” she thought to herself. He got up to meet her, "Hi…Tracey?” he said. "Yes! Hi!" said she, “Isaac, right?" "Yeah" said Isaac nervously, "Can I get us some coffee?" It was over this cup of coffee that the two shared their interests— their love for traveling, board games and volunteering abroad. They talked about family and things that were important to them and they both began to become more and more comfortable as they laughed away the anxiety and nerves. After a few hours of conversation, they knew there was something special. This first date turned into a second date, then a third and then many more.

          Tracey knew she was falling for Isaac when she surprised him at the airport right before Thanksgiving as he was heading home to visit his family. Although she didn’t get on a plane at that time, he eventually took her to meet the parents over Christmas. Fast forward— after traveling to three countries and many home renovation projects later, including surviving a "long distance" Tacoma-to-Seattle relationship, they are excited to begin this new chapter together!

          Before embarking on a trip to Belize in March, Isaac saw a window of opportunity to stage a surprise proposal and execute his master plan. After a full day of exploring, cliff jumping and swimming at Big Rock Falls, Isaac and Tracey decided to head back towards the trail. On the way back, they stopped at a large river. No one was around so Isaac set up his camera, ran over beside her to pretend to take a photo. This was his chance. Isaac turned to Tracey with his heart pounding.  "I haven't said this to anyone before, but I love you and"— suddenly a dog came darting out from the trail with the owner chasing after and ran towards the camera, almost knocking it into the river. “Umm…let’s continue this later,”  Isaac said.

          Isaac was sure Tracey had caught on, but she still had no idea. Later that evening, they drove to another waterfall outlook. The coast was clear. Isaac set up his camera to take a photo. Before Tracey realized what was happening Isaac was down on one knee. She was in such shock. Isaac asked her to marry him, and she said, "Yes!" Due to the excitement of the moment, they hadn't noticed the swarm of mosquitoes that had been attacking them the whole time. After a panicked run to the car, they counted a total of 128 bites between them, but it was all worth it!
